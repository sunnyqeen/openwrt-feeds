Description:  The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
 when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
 has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due
 to signals or regular timeouts.
 
 libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven
 network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch()
 and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change
 the event loop.
 
 This package contains the libevent shared library historically
 containing both the core & extra libraries.

Description:  libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel. The main features of this library are:
 .
 * Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 * Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 * Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building, validating,
 parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 * Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction layer
 on top of this library.
 .
 * Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the library
 is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the programmer is not
 forced to use them.
